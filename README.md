# MonsterGladiators-Java-Edition
This is the Java Edition of my previously created C++ text based RPG MonsterGladiators

Take note before downloading this code:
- the failsound.mp3 inside the sound directory should be converted to .wav
- I uploaded the mp3 file here since the .wav file exceeds 25MB, just convert the mp3 to .wav to make the sound work when you try my game

THANKS!

[UPDATE]

Patch 2/27/2024
- Fixed last known bug (hopefully) to the game where when the player starts the player death or monster death animation then they click return immediately. Game will bug so I have to temporarily set the visibility of the return button during the death animations to false and only set to true when they get to the fail screen or victory screen.
